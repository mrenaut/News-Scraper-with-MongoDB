# news-scraper
Full stack application using REST APIs, Node. JS, and MongoDB to collect and display articles from the New York Times website and provide a comments section for users.




This time we extend the previous Eat Da Burger project which was a full stack burger-logger web app. We continue to use Node, Express server, and Handlebars for view generation. MySQL remains our database, but we switch to using Sequelize ORM. 

The app itself is fairly straightforward but the focus here was to practice data flow, routing, view generation, etc., in a full stack MVC design pattern.
